## Notes
`script.js` is my first draft based on what I knew at the time. After writing it and discussing better approaches with my developer friends, I rewrote the code, which is in `script-new.js`. I'm leaving `script.js` in the project for posterity.

In refactorizing the code, I learned how to use JavaScript objects.
